# Asthetics

These are the final goals of how the game should feel to play, the emotions it should invoke in the player, and the senses it should incite during interaction.

Of the formally defined asthetics from MDA:

The two asthetics:
Sensation - Game as sense-pleasure 
Expression - Game as self-discovery
will be the primary focus of all mechanics implemented.


Other asthetics that will likely arise:
Fantasy - Game as make-believe
Narrative - Game as drama
Discovery - Game as uncharted territory 
Submission - Game as pastime

# Mechanics

Customize and create the rulesets of agent groups. 

The player can perform tweaks to the ruleset of groups of agents(or just one agent) during the process of the simulation.

Provide a framework for creating behavior rules for agents that allows for complex interactions to emerge.

Agents can interact with each other, and with the environment.

Agents can modify their rulesets during their lifetime, based on interactions and their existing ruleset.

The player is able to see, in real time, various statistics and trends about the agent population.

Different groups of agents are allowed to have different rulesets.

Rulesets are constructed of the same base and can intermix between agents; certain rules can encourage or discourage this.

The rulesets will encompass attributes that are fixed as well as attributes that are fluid. Some attributes can be somewhere in between fixed and fluid.

Agents can modify their environment.

Enviromental units have some primary properties that can be modified namely composition and height, and then other secondary properties that arise from surrounding environmental units; such as temperature and precepitation.

Music occurs rarely, almost randomly. The majority of the sounds in the game are generate by the interactions of agents and the environment.

A group of eps with a similar starting ruleset begins life on a small relatively flat plane. The eps sustain themselves by harvesting wild grains. The plane only supports enough grains for a population of fifty or so eps. The grains grow better in an environment with a certian composition and rainfall. Each ep is able to move environmental properties from one environmental unit to another; or move them across multiple units and deposit them. The eps begin to experiment and attempt to maximize grain growth capacity.
