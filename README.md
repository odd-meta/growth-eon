# Growth Eon

A simulation game of societal growth using the sugar scape model. The mechanics and overall inspiration are credited to "Growing Artificial Societies" by Joshua M. Epstein and Robert Axtell. This game will provide a visually engagin, auditorially engaging, and most of all accessible way to interact with a sugar scape like simulation. 

# Running

On windows either use the play_growth_eon.bat batch script to run directly from the source files or use the dist.bat script to construct a fused love2d executable in the "dist" directory. The fused exe is created from whatever the current source files are in game. The dist.bat script assumes a working installation of 7-zip.
